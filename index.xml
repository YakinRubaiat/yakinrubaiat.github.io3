      <description>In Bangladesh, we don&amp;rsquo;t see so many startups as we should. First, we should talk about why we need startups in Bangladesh in the first place.
When we think about a startup, lot&amp;rsquo;s of us think like this, oh great, it&amp;rsquo;s a business, lot&amp;rsquo;s money but in real life mainly computer science domain it&amp;rsquo;s not the case. In this domain, it&amp;rsquo;s mainly about the break down a problem and solves it by technology.</description>

      <description>1. Abstract In this study, we have proposed an analysis of different method based on a neural network for predicting type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The main problems that we are trying to solve are to find which type of model works best for predicting diabetes. The analysis is comprised of two parts, by applying data-recovery with the neural network and by applying k-means with the neural network. The consultation shows that why some model is good at predicting diabetes and is it computationally expensive or not.</description>

      <description>Along with Ford Prefect, Dent barely escapes the Earth&amp;rsquo;s destruction as it is demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur spends the next several years, still wearing his dressing gown, helplessly launched from crisis to crisis while trying to straighten out his lifestyle.
 He rather enjoys tea, but seems to have trouble obtaining it in the far reaches of the galaxy.
 In time, he learns how to fly and carves a niche for himself as a sandwich-maker.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
